Hangman
=======

I was perusing github one fine evening and stumbled upon a hangman exercise on one of the trending repos:
https://github.com/bitmakerlabs/hangman

It looks like creating hangman in ruby using tdd was a course exercise.

I thought this might be a fun, quick project to try my hand at, and before you
know it... I was up until 2 tweaking this silly thing.

Good times.
